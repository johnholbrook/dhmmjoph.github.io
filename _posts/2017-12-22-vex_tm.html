<!-- <p>
	Recently I've been using and learning about the <a href="http://vextm.dwabtech.com">VEX 
	Tournament Manager</a> software for volunteering at VEX Robotics Competition events.
	More recently, I produced a series of eight YouTube videos, exploring the software and
	walking through some of its functionality throughout a sample tournament. For convenience,
	all eight videos are embedded below. First, though, some disclaimers and notes:
</p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>I am not affiliated with VEX, IFI, RECF, or the developers of the VEX TM software.</b> 
			This isn't an official video series.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>This is not a complete guide.</b> There are complete guides available online, including
			the user guide that comes with the software.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>I probably got some stuff wrong</b>, and there's definitely functionality that I missed
			(see disclaimer #1).
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
	VEX TM is a complex software package with a lot of functionality. The best way to learn about the software
	is to use it. Thus, I'd encourage new users to play around with VEX TM in pretend emvironments before using
	it at actual tournaments. For such purposes, the team data CSV file I used can be downloaded
	<a href="{{site.url}}/vex_tm/made_up_vex_teams.csv">here</a>.
</p>

With that, on to the videos: -->
<p>
	Several years ago I put together a series of videos showing the basic usage of <a href="https://vextm.dwabtech.com">VEX Tournament
	Manager</a> and walking through a sample tournament. The feature set of TM has changed quite a bit since I recorded these videos,
	but I think they still serve as a reasonable introduction.
