    <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">Note:</span> As of October 2022, this site is no longer online. I didn't feel like
    paying more money to keep a silly joke going for another year, so let the domain name expire.

    If you get the opportunity to link to your website on social media profiles, GitHub, web forms, etc., but you don't have one,
    this website is perfect for you:

<figure class="figure w-100">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid w-90 mx-auto" src="/img/idonthaveawebsite.png">
