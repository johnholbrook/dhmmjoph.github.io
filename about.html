 <!-- <p class="about">
 	Hi, I'm <b>John Holbrook</b>. I do lots of things, but these days I'm mostly a student at 
 	<a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University</a> in Athens, Ohio, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
 	(I have <a href="http://cs.ohio.edu/~jholbroo/">a page</a> on the Ohio U. CS Department web server with 
 	more information about my academic persuits.)
 </p>

<p class="about">
	I'm particularly interested in educational robotics competitions, and much of my spare time is spent volunteering
	at educational robotics events, including <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/">VEX Robotics Competition</a>, and 
	<a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/competition/vex-iq-challenge-overview">VEX IQ Challenge</a> events.
	I mostly volunteer at events organized by the <a href="http://wvroboticsalliance.org/">West Virginia Robotics
	Alliance</a>, though I also help out with a few VRC events in Ohio when time allows. 
</p>

<p class="about">
	I grew up racing sailboats in the summer months. During the summers of 2015-2018, I worked as an instructor 
	at the <a href="http://www.orleansyachtclub.org/sailing/junior-sailing-program">Orleans Yacht Club Junior Sailing 
	Program</a> in Orleans, Massachusetts, where I helped to instruct children ages 8-18 in sailing, 
	from beginner to advanced levels. From 2012 to 2016, I was also a member of the program's 420 race team.
</p>

<p class="about">
	I'm also involved with Ohio University's <a href="https://twitter.com/ohiosailing">student-run club sailing team</a>.
	For calendar year 2019, I am the team's Fleet Captain &amp; Safety Officer, with responsibility for equipment maintenance
	and member safety during practices and regattas. I previously filled this role in calendar year 2017. In 2018, I was the
	team's President &amp; Commodore, overseeing the team's operation and ensuring compliance with university and conference
	rules.
</p>

 <p class="about">I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, where in 2016 I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington_High_School_(West_Virginia)">Huntington High School</a>. While there, I helped found the school's VEX Robotics Competition and Science Olympiad teams.</p>

 <p class="about">There used to be a joke at the end of this bio about how pompous it was to write a bio of oneself in the third person. Now that I've rewritten the bio in the first person, that joke doesn't really fit anymore.</p> -->

<p>
	Hi, I'm <b>John Holbrook</b>. I'm interested in educational robotics, computer programming, sailing, and Formula 1 ‚Äî 
	but not necessarily in that order.
</p>

<p>
	Currently I'm an AmeriCorps member at the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/index.html">NASA Katherine Johnson IV&V Facility's Educator
	Resource Center</a>, where I help to start new <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/">VRC</a> and
	<a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexiq/competition/vex-iq-challenge-overview">VIQC</a> teams throughout West Virginia, organize and run 
	robotics tournaments, plan and teach robotics summer camps, and otherwise contribute to the ERC's mission.
</p>

<p>
	Before that, I was a student at <a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University</a> in Athens, Ohio from 2016-2020, where I studied Computer Science and helped 
	run OU's <a href="https://twitter.com/ohiosailing">student-run club sailing team</a>. During my three years on the team's executive board,
	we drastically increased our recruitment of new and experienced sailors, (re)grew into a fully-fledged university club sport, and won our first
	regatta in over 10 years. When I wasn't studying or sailing, I spent a lot of my spare time volunteering at robotics events.
</p>

<p>
	Before <em>that</em>, I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia and Orleans, Massachusetts, where I played with robots, learned to
	sail and race sailboats, got interested in programming, and took things apart, usually in a misguided attempt to fix them.
</p>

<p>
	In my spare time, I like to read, listen to podcasts, and work on personal projects.

	Somehow I doubt I'll ever do better than 17 days - but I'll have to try in 2022.
