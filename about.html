title: About John
---

<p>
	As you can probably guess from the domain name and header text, I am <b>John Holbrook</b>.
</p>

<p>
	Professionally, I work at the <a href="https://www.nasaivverc.org">NASA IV&V Education Resource Center</a> in Fairmont,
	West Virginia. I am the lead for our <a href="https://www.wvrobot.org">robotics outreach efforts</a>, including running
	student robotics competitions across WV and coordinating a series of annual summer camps.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I'm interested in computer programming, making things, 3D printing, acronyms, and similar topics. This site
	lists several of my projects, as well as information about some topics of interest.
</p>

<p>
	I have a degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://ohio.edu">Ohio University</a> in Athens, Ohio, where I also helped
	lead the school's <a href="https://twitter.com/ohiosailing">student-run club sailing team</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia and Orleans, Massachusetts, where I played with robots, learned to
	sail and race sailboats, got interested in programming, and took things apart, usually in a misguided attempt to fix them.
